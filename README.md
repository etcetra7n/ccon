# CCON

CCON (Copy CONtent) (pronounce 'see-kon') is a software that can copy a
file into your clipboard

Currently we support only windows system. But you can manually build the
software on pretty much any system

#### Features

- You can right click on any file type to click "Copy content" to copy its 
  content
- You can create a Clipboard State File, which is basically a text file with
  the extension '.cpy'. You can write any information you want in this file,
  and you can quickly access this information, just by double clicking it 
  (this will copy the file content to your clipboard)

**Note**: All the above features will only work if you install ccon using the
setup wizard executable which is available in the release page (available for
both 32-bit and 64-bit systems)

#### Command Line Usage

```shell
$ ccon file.txt
```
